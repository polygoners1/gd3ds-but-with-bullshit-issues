# FAQ
### How do I install this on my 3DS?
Download either the .3dsx or .cia file and place it on your SD Card, then depending on which file you chose, launch it through the Homebrew Launcher, or install it to your home menu through FBI. As of right now, there is no download available on the Universal Updater, however this may change in the future.

### The game is saying something about "missing DSP firmware", what do I do?
If you're playing on actual hardware this shouldn't be an issue as most homebrew tutorials dump this file in the process. If you're playing on an emulator, navigate to ```(your emulator's data folder)\sdmc\3ds\``` and create a file named ```dspfirm.cdc``` in said location. It can be completely empty for all the emulator cares, it just has to be present.

### How do I play / add custom levels?
You'll need to either export a copy of your level of choice using the [GDShare Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/hjfod.gdshare) or download an archive of said level from [GDHistory](https://history.geometrydash.eu/). If the level uses a custom song, you'll also need to either extract it from your Geometry Dash songs folder (```%localappdata%\GeometryDash``` on Windows), or download it seperately from [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio). Once you have the level .gmd (and song, renamed to its Newgrounds ID) prepared, copy them to ```\3ds\gd3ds\external_levels\``` and ```\3ds\gd3ds\saved_songs\``` on your SD Card respectively. Putting the .gmd's into additional folders within the main ```\external_levels\``` directory is supported. Do keep in mind, however, that any objects from updates 2.0 and above will not load + have the chance to crash your game, and object-heavy levels are not guaranteed to be playable.

### X button doesn't work / X effect is missing / X object doesn't do anything
This project is WIP, so chances are that feature simply is not implemented yet. If you think you found an actual bug, you're welcome to open a GitHub Issue or (preferably) ask on the Discord server.

### Are you going to add a level editor?
The short answer is no. The long answer is that it's simply too much work for something that would run poorly on the already underpowered 3DS hardware, would be unable to upload levels to the Geometry Dash servers and that 99% of people would not care about. 

### Can you add X feature / X gamemode / X level?
Everything that's planned to be implemented is listed in the planned features section above - in short, anything major from updates above 1.9 will not be added. However, if you come up with an improvement, or a quality of life feature the game could use, you're welcome to suggest it in the Discord server.

### 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 when????
Get out.
